# Project_PlanProject Plan: HIV infections in New York City

## Project Objective

This project aims to analyze the patterns and disparities of HIV infections in New York City, focusing on how race/ethnicity, age group, gender and neighborhood influence the rate of contamination. The primary goal is to identify which groups are most affected as they will serve as good indication of where public health interventions could have a huge impact.

## Project Plan

1. Data Understanding: What does my datasets look like?

   Review dataset structures: In this phase, I will seek to understand both my datasets.
   Check each column for example, to see what it represents. \
   Questions like: Are they any missing values? What’s my data types and range? Will be answered here.\

2. Data Cleaning

   • Standardize categorical values & ensure consistent across both datasets\
   • Handle null values/missing value.\

3. Data Integration\
   • Use SQL to merge both datasets on either Year, Neighborhood or Race in order to create a combined\ view of sex, age, and neighborhood impacts.\
   • Reshaping the data for easier analysis.\

4. Data Exploration\
   • Descriptive Stats:\
   o Find total cases by race, age group, sex, and neighborhood.\
   • Identify trends:\
   o How have diagnoses changed over time for each group?\
   • Group Comparisons:\
   o Which race has the highest infection rate in each neighborhood?\
   o Gender disparities across neighborhoods?\
   o Are younger or older age groups more affected?\

5. Data Visualization\
   Using plots to reveal patterns:\
   • Heatmaps for HIV rates by neighborhood and race.\
   • Bar charts for infections by age and gender.\
   • Time series to observe yearly trends.\
   • Create a Tableau Dashboard from revealed patterns\

6. Conclusion & Recommendations\
   • Summarize key findings: Which groups and locations are most at risk?\
   • Suggest targeted public health strategies.\
   • Highlight limitations of the analysis (e.g., lack of behavioral or socioeconomic data).\
